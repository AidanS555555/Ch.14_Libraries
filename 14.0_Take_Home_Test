HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: ______________________
 
For this test, take your 30 box program and remove the Ball Class into a seperate file called Box_Builder.py. Now just
import the Ball Class into your main program. No need to pull request this. Just show it to your instructor if you can get
it to work. Use if __name__ =="__main__":
